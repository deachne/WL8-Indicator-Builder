## AI Assistant Improvements
The AI Assistant component has been significantly enhanced with the following improvements:

1. **Enhanced User Interface**:
   - Improved scrolling mechanism for better message navigation
   - Enhanced message contrast with blue background and white text for user messages
   - Fixed positioning of the input area at the bottom of the chat interface
   - Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes

2. **Code Editor Integration**:
   - Added code block extraction from AI responses
   - Implemented "Apply to Editor" buttons for code blocks
   - Added "Clear & Apply Code" button for replacing editor content
   - Connected the AI Assistant to the code editor in the Builder page
   - Added logic to detect C# code and apply it to the appropriate editor tab
   - Implemented direct editor control for clearing and replacing content

3. **Specialized AI Prompt**:
   - Positioned the AI as an expert in WL8 indicator development
   - Enhanced responses for indicator building requests
   - Included best practices for indicator development
   - Added instructions for using the "Apply to Editor" button
   - Provided code templates when no specific examples are available
   - Added specialized templates for common indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)

4. **Improved Intent Detection**:
   - Added detection for code deletion requests
   - Implemented pattern matching for specific indicator types
   - Added parameter extraction from user queries (e.g., periods, thresholds)
   - Enhanced handling of compound requests (e.g., "delete the code and create an SMA crossover")

5. **Consistent Experience Across RAG Systems**:
   - Standardized responses across all three RAG implementations (standard, enhanced, and Supabase)
   - Consistent code example formatting and presentation
   - Unified best practices recommendations
   - Improved error handling and fallbacks
   - Added structured action information to RAG responses

These improvements create a more seamless experience where users can easily interact with the AI Assistant to build indicators, get help with code, and apply code examples directly to the editor with a single click. The AI can now understand and execute more complex requests, such as "delete the code and create a simple SMA 10 period crossover," providing a more intuitive and efficient workflow for indicator development.

## Notes
- The WL8 documentation is available in the GitHub repository at https://github.com/deachne/WL8-pkm
- The documentation includes 75 API reference files and 27 framework files
- The design follows a blue/teal color scheme for a professional look
- The RAG system now uses Supabase with pgvector for better document vectorization and retrieval
- The AI assistant uses a code-aware retrieval mechanism that preserves code examples and their context

## RAG System Implementation
The RAG system has been enhanced with Supabase integration and code-aware document processing. Key components include:

1. **Supabase with pgvector Integration**: 
   - PostgreSQL-based vector database for efficient semantic search
   - Managed service with no server maintenance required
   - Automatic fallback to in-memory system if Supabase is unavailable
   - Batched document processing for handling large documentation sets
   - Configurable similarity search parameters

2. **Code-Aware Document Processing**:
   - Intelligent extraction of code blocks with their surrounding context
   - Special handling for code examples to preserve their integrity
   - Metadata enrichment for better retrieval and filtering
   - Separate storage of code blocks and explanatory text

3. **Enhanced Retrieval**:
   - Semantic search using embeddings for better relevance
   - Hybrid search combining keyword and semantic approaches
   - Re-ranking system to improve result quality
   - Filtering by document type, language, and other metadata
   - Prioritization of code examples for programming-related queries

4. **AI Assistant Integration**:
   - Contextual responses based on retrieved documentation
   - Presentation of code examples with explanatory text
   - Suggestions for related documentation
   - Automatic detection of Supabase availability

The system includes scripts for:
- Importing documentation from GitHub with code-aware processing
- Importing processed documents into Supabase
- Verifying the Supabase setup
- Testing the RAG system with various queries
- Legacy scripts for ChromaDB (maintained for backward compatibility)

Future enhancements to the RAG system could include:
- Enhancing the re-ranking system with more sophisticated algorithms
- Implementing code generation capabilities based on documentation context
- Enhancing the AI assistant with more domain-specific knowledge
- Adding user feedback mechanisms to improve retrieval quality

## Monaco Editor Implementation
The Monaco Editor implementation enhances the code editing experience with the following features:

1. **Syntax Highlighting**: Proper C# syntax highlighting with color-coded keywords, types, and functions
2. **Line Numbers**: Clear line numbering for better code navigation
3. **Code Folding**: Ability to collapse code blocks for better readability
4. **IntelliSense and Code Completion**: Custom C# snippets and auto-completion for:
   - C# keywords (using, namespace, class, etc.)
   - WealthLab types (DataSeries, IndicatorBase, etc.)
   - WealthLab functions (SMA, EMA, RSI, etc.)
5. **Error Diagnostics**: Basic syntax error detection for:
   - Missing semicolons
   - Unbalanced braces
   - Missing namespace declarations
6. **Editor Controls**: Toggle between read-only and editable modes

This implementation significantly improves the developer experience when creating and editing indicators, making the process more efficient and user-friendly.

## TradingView Lightweight Charts Implementation
The TradingView Lightweight Charts implementation enhances the chart visualization experience with the following features:

1. **Candlestick Charts**: Professional-grade candlestick charts for price visualization
2. **Technical Indicators**: Support for multiple technical indicators:
   - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
   - Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
   - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
   - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
   - Bollinger Bands
3. **Responsive Design**: Charts automatically resize to fit their container
4. **Dark Theme**: Styled to match the application's dark theme
5. **Real-time Updates**: Charts update in real-time when:
   - Different indicators are selected
   - Template changes are made
   - Symbol selection changes
6. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for smooth indicator transitions
7. **Interactive Elements**: Time scale navigation, crosshair for precise readings
8. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient rendering for smooth performance

This implementation provides a professional-grade charting solution that allows users to visualize their indicators directly in the application, making it easier to understand and refine their trading strategies.

## Supabase Migration
The project has been migrated from ChromaDB to Supabase for vector storage, providing several benefits:

1. **Simplified Infrastructure**: No need to run a separate ChromaDB server
2. **Improved Reliability**: PostgreSQL is a battle-tested database technology
3. **Scalability**: Supabase can scale to handle larger document collections
4. **Additional Features**: Supabase provides authentication, storage, and realtime subscriptions

The migration involved:
- Creating a Supabase client utility
- Implementing a Supabase RAG system
- Updating API routes to use Supabase
- Creating scripts for importing documents to Supabase
- Adding a verification script for Supabase setup
- Maintaining backward compatibility with ChromaDB

The Supabase implementation uses the pgvector extension for PostgreSQL, which provides efficient vector similarity search capabilities. The implementation includes:
- A documentation table for storing content, embeddings, and metadata
- A match_documents function for similarity search
- Batched document processing for efficient imports
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

For detailed setup instructions, see the SUPABASE_SETUP.md file.
