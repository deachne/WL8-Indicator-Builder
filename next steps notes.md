- Add community features to the Q&A platform
- Optimize performance and responsiveness

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for these future enhancements while delivering immediate functionality. The AI assistant can now provide contextually relevant assistance when users request help with building indicators or strategies, retrieving and referencing specific parts of the WL8 documentation.

## Notes
- The WL8 documentation is available in the GitHub repository at https://github.com/deachne/WL8-pkm
- The documentation includes 75 API reference files and 27 framework files
- The design follows a blue/teal color scheme for a professional look
- The RAG system now uses ChromaDB for better document vectorization and retrieval
- The AI assistant uses a code-aware retrieval mechanism that preserves code examples and their context

## RAG System Implementation
The RAG system has been enhanced with ChromaDB integration and code-aware document processing. Key components include:

1. **ChromaDB Integration**: 
   - Vector database for efficient semantic search
   - Automatic fallback to in-memory system if ChromaDB is unavailable
   - Batched document processing for handling large documentation sets
   - Configurable similarity search parameters

2. **Code-Aware Document Processing**:
   - Intelligent extraction of code blocks with their surrounding context
   - Special handling for code examples to preserve their integrity
   - Metadata enrichment for better retrieval and filtering
   - Separate storage of code blocks and explanatory text

3. **Enhanced Retrieval**:
   - Semantic search using embeddings for better relevance
   - Hybrid search combining keyword and semantic approaches
   - Filtering by document type, language, and other metadata
   - Prioritization of code examples for programming-related queries

4. **AI Assistant Integration**:
   - Contextual responses based on retrieved documentation
   - Presentation of code examples with explanatory text
   - Suggestions for related documentation
   - Automatic detection of ChromaDB availability

The system includes scripts for:
- Importing documentation from GitHub with code-aware processing
- Running a ChromaDB server for vector storage
- Importing processed documents into ChromaDB
- Testing the RAG system with various queries

Future enhancements to the RAG system could include:
- Adding support for more advanced retrieval techniques like re-ranking
- Implementing code generation capabilities based on documentation context
- Enhancing the AI assistant with more domain-specific knowledge
- Adding user feedback mechanisms to improve retrieval quality

## Monaco Editor Implementation
The Monaco Editor implementation enhances the code editing experience with the following features:

1. **Syntax Highlighting**: Proper C# syntax highlighting with color-coded keywords, types, and functions
2. **Line Numbers**: Clear line numbering for better code navigation
3. **Code Folding**: Ability to collapse code blocks for better readability
4. **IntelliSense and Code Completion**: Custom C# snippets and auto-completion for:
   - C# keywords (using, namespace, class, etc.)
   - WealthLab types (DataSeries, IndicatorBase, etc.)
   - WealthLab functions (SMA, EMA, RSI, etc.)
5. **Error Diagnostics**: Basic syntax error detection for:
   - Missing semicolons
   - Unbalanced braces
   - Missing namespace declarations
6. **Editor Controls**: Toggle between read-only and editable modes

This implementation significantly improves the developer experience when creating and editing indicators, making the process more efficient and user-friendly.

## TradingView Lightweight Charts Implementation
The TradingView Lightweight Charts implementation enhances the chart visualization experience with the following features:

1. **Candlestick Charts**: Professional-grade candlestick charts for price visualization
2. **Technical Indicators**: Support for multiple technical indicators:
   - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
   - Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
   - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
   - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
   - Bollinger Bands
3. **Responsive Design**: Charts automatically resize to fit their container
4. **Dark Theme**: Styled to match the application's dark theme
5. **Real-time Updates**: Charts update in real-time when:
   - Different indicators are selected
   - Template changes are made
   - Symbol selection changes
6. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for smooth indicator transitions
7. **Interactive Elements**: Time scale navigation, crosshair for precise readings
8. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient rendering for smooth performance

This implementation provides a professional-grade charting solution that allows users to visualize their indicators directly in the application, making it easier to understand and refine their trading strategies.
