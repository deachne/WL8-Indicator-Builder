# WL8 Indicator Builder - Project Outline

## Project Overview
The WL8 Indicator Builder is a platform for creating, testing, and sharing indicators for Wealth-Lab 8. It combines documentation browsing, AI-assisted indicator development, and a Q&A platform to provide a comprehensive tool for WL8 developers.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **RAG System**: ChromaDB (planned)
- **Code Editor**: Monaco Editor (planned)
- **Chart Visualization**: TradingView Lightweight Charts (planned)

## Repository
- GitHub: [https://github.com/deachne/WL8-Indicator-Builder](https://github.com/deachne/WL8-Indicator-Builder)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Homepage âœ…
- [x] Set up Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- [x] Create basic project structure
- [x] Implement homepage with hero section, feature cards, and how-it-works guide
- [x] Design and implement navigation and footer
- [x] Set up GitHub repository

### Phase 2: Documentation Browser âœ…
- [x] Create documentation browser UI with search functionality
- [x] Set up markdown rendering system
- [x] Import and process WL8 API and framework documentation
- [x] Implement documentation search and navigation

### Phase 3: Indicator Builder Interface âœ…
- [x] Create placeholder for indicator builder page
- [x] Implement code editor with C# syntax highlighting
- [x] Develop chart visualization component
- [x] Set up responsive layout and state management
- [x] Create template selector and symbol input
- [x] Implement copy, export, and share functionality
- [x] Add AI assistant integration for indicator development

### Phase 4: RAG System and AI Assistant âœ…
- [x] Implement mock RAG system for document retrieval
- [x] Create API endpoints for querying and suggestions
- [x] Develop AI assistant chat component
- [x] Integrate AI assistant with documentation browser
- [ ] Replace mock implementation with ChromaDB (future enhancement)

### Phase 5: Q&A Platform âœ…
- [x] Create placeholder for Q&A page
- [x] Design and implement Q&A interface
- [x] Integrate AI assistant with Q&A page
- [ ] Add community features (future enhancement)

### Phase 6: Integration and Refinement ðŸ”„
- [x] Connect all components and features
- [x] Optimize performance and responsiveness
- [ ] Add user authentication (optional)
- [x] Implement final polish and refinements

## Current Status
- Homepage with all sections implemented
- Documentation browser with search functionality
- Indicator builder with code editor, chart visualization, and template selection
- AI assistant integrated with documentation, builder, and Q&A pages
- Mock RAG system implemented for document retrieval
- API endpoints for querying and suggestions
- Responsive layout with optimized UI components

## Next Steps
As outlined in the updated PROJECT.md, the next steps for the project are:

### Indicator Builder Enhancement
- Implement Monaco editor for C# code editing
- Integrate TradingView charts for visualization
- Create console output component for debugging

### RAG System Improvements
- Replace the mock implementation with ChromaDB for better document vectorization
- Add support for more advanced retrieval techniques
- Implement code generation capabilities based on documentation context

### User Experience
- Implement user authentication for saving and sharing indicators
- Add community features to the Q&A platform
- Optimize performance and responsiveness

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for these future enhancements while delivering immediate functionality. The AI assistant can now provide contextually relevant assistance when users request help with building indicators or strategies, retrieving and referencing specific parts of the WL8 documentation.

## Notes
- The WL8 documentation is available in the GitHub repository at https://github.com/deachne/WL8-pkm
- The documentation includes 75 API reference files and 27 framework files
- The design follows a blue/teal color scheme for a professional look
- The mock RAG system can be replaced with ChromaDB in the future for better document vectorization
- The AI assistant currently uses a simple retrieval mechanism but can be enhanced with more advanced techniques

## RAG System Implementation
The current RAG system implementation uses a mock approach that leverages the existing search functionality. This provides immediate functionality while allowing for future enhancements. Key components include:

1. **Document Retrieval**: Uses the existing search function to find relevant documentation based on user queries
2. **AI Assistant**: Provides contextual responses based on retrieved documentation
3. **Suggestions**: Offers related documentation based on the current context

Future enhancements to the RAG system could include:
- Replacing the mock implementation with ChromaDB for better document vectorization
- Adding support for more advanced retrieval techniques
- Implementing code generation capabilities based on documentation context
- Enhancing the AI assistant with more domain-specific knowledge
